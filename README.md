# Inttegro demo applications

This directory contains production-shaped applications that demonstrate how to
integrate Inttegro inside experiences customers would genuinely use. They share
one security and checkout contract, but each story has a real product context,
responsive information architecture, accessible states, and its own visual
identity.

The repository is designed to live at `demos/` in the Commerce checkout. The
web and server examples can also be cloned and run independently. Until the
mobile SDKs and Java SDK 5.0.0 are published, the SwiftUI, Compose, Flutter,
React Native, and Spring Boot examples resolve those SDKs from the parent
Commerce checkout.

## V1 product stories

| Story | Demos | Customer journey |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Kora Market** | Next.js, Nuxt, Rails, Laravel | Discover the Dawn Brew Set, choose a finish, review the bag, and continue to hosted checkout. |
| **Afterglow Sessions** | Express, Django, FastAPI | Explore an intimate live lineup, review venue details, and reserve a courtyard ticket. |
| **Ledgerline** | Go, Spring Boot | Review a client invoice, inspect its service lines, and settle the balance securely. |
| **Kora Market mobile** | SwiftUI, Compose, Flutter, React Native | Browse a native product detail experience and present the Inttegro payment sheet. |

Original product and event artwork is generated for this repository and stored
locally under [`assets/`](./assets); demos do not depend on third-party image
hosts or runtime font services.

## Current release

The current release is **1.2.2**. Use
[`releases/v1.2.2.json`](./releases/v1.2.2.json) to resolve each demo to its
immutable Git tag and integration entry points. Studio and external
documentation must link through those tags rather than `main`; see
[RELEASING.md](./RELEASING.md) for the versioning, permalink, signature, and
correction policy.

### V2

ASP.NET Core, NestJS, React + Vite, Angular, and SvelteKit follow after the V1
contract and verification suite are stable.

## Shared journey

Each V1 demo:

1. Places payment inside a complete storefront, ticketing, invoice, or mobile
   commerce journey.
2. Collects only the customer and order data required by that journey.
3. Creates and finalizes an order through an official Inttegro SDK.
4. Supplies explicit completion and cancellation URLs.
5. Redirects the browser to the hosted checkout URL returned by Inttegro.
6. Explains that the browser return is not authoritative fulfillment evidence.
7. Handles configuration, validation, and Inttegro API failures without leaking
   credentials or raw internal errors.

See [INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md](./INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) for the rationale,
trade-offs, production alternatives, and links to canonical Inttegro
documentation. Its companion
[`integration-decisions.json`](./integration-decisions.json) exposes the same
decision model to documentation tools and machine readers. Source comments use
stable `INTTEGRO:*` markers and decision IDs from that registry.

See [CONTRACT.md](./CONTRACT.md) for the normative acceptance contract and
[MOBILE.md](./MOBILE.md) for the mobile backend boundary and device checks.

## Deploy your own

The suite includes a public-facing catalogue, checked-in provider manifests,
and a machine-readable deployment matrix. Start with
[`DEPLOYING.md`](./DEPLOYING.md) for the reader experience, environment
contract, provider trade-offs, immutable deployment refs, and verification
gates. [`deployments.json`](./deployments.json) is the source of truth consumed
by tools and the generated catalogue.

The public URLs are `demos.inttegro.dev` and
`{framework}-demo.inttegro.dev`. The domain is active on Cloudflare. Reader
deployment manifests remain host-neutral; Inttegro-owned custom-domain bindings
are attached during release operations so a cloned demo never targets an
Inttegro hostname. All application code also works on localhost and
provider-assigned preview origins.

## Configuration

Server demos use these environment variables:

```dotenv
INTTEGRO_API_KEY=sk_test_replace_me
INTTEGRO_DEMO_PRODUCT_ID=prod_replace_me
INTTEGRO_DEMO_PRICE_ID=pr_replace_me
INTTEGRO_DEMO_CUSTOMER_ID=cu_replace_me
INTTEGRO_DEMO_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

`INTTEGRO_API_KEY` must never be exposed to browser or mobile code.
`INTTEGRO_DEMO_PRODUCT_ID` and `INTTEGRO_DEMO_PRICE_ID` select the catalog item
that the trusted server looks up and validates at checkout; public requests do
not supply product identity or amount.
`INTTEGRO_DEMO_CUSTOMER_ID` is used only by the Next.js mobile-order route and
must also remain server-side.
`INTTEGRO_DEMO_PUBLIC_URL` is the externally reachable origin used for checkout
completion and cancellation URLs. Each demo documents its own default port.

## Supporting assets

The cURL examples, Postman collection, shared fixtures, and automated contract
checks are supporting assets rather than separate demo applications.

Run the dependency-free suite check from this repository's root:
