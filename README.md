# Inttegro + FastAPI demo

**Afterglow Sessions** pairs an editorial Angular checkout island with an
API-first FastAPI backend. The visible courtyard ticket and the server-side
Inttegro order share the same product, price, and fulfillment story.

```bash
npm install
npm run build:client
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
cp .env.example .env
set -a && source .env && set +a
uvicorn src.app.main:app --reload --port 3005
```

Open <http://localhost:3005>. Configure `INTTEGRO_DEMO_PRODUCT_ID` and
`INTTEGRO_DEMO_PRICE_ID` with the active Afterglow admission Product and Price.
FastAPI resolves and validates both server-side; the reservation form supplies
no product or amount. The request handler uses `AsyncInttegroClient`, awaits
both API calls, and reuses its HTTP connection pool across requests. Angular 21
builds the browser client with strict templates. Run `npm run build:client` and
`pytest` for the focused checks.

## Try the Checkout presentations

The reservation form offers **Embedded**, **Modal**, and **Hosted page**.
Embedded is the default. FastAPI returns a no-store `{ orderId }` for the first
two and a `303` hosted-page redirect for the third or when JavaScript is absent.

Read [`client/checkout-flow.component.ts`](./client/checkout-flow.component.ts)
for the Angular lifecycle and trust boundary. It mounts the published
`@inttegro/angular` component for embedded Checkout. The currently published
0.2.0 adapter embeds Checkout, so the modal example deliberately places that
same component inside an accessible Angular-owned `<dialog>`. This is a useful
application-owned alternative; a future adapter release can own the dialog,
focus management, and dismissal without changing the FastAPI endpoint.

## Run with Docker

After configuring `.env`, run `docker compose up --build --wait`. Compose
starts the production image at <http://localhost:3005> and monitors
`GET /health`. Use
`docker compose down` to stop it. Set `INTTEGRO_DEMO_PUBLIC_URL` to the exact
HTTPS origin before exposing the container publicly.

Cloud Run, Railway, and Render build the released multi-stage Dockerfile, which
compiles Angular before assembling the Python runtime. The Railway
template is pinned to its release branch and exact commit. Cloudflare runs the
same FastAPI routes through its ASGI adapter and serves `/static/*` from Workers
Static Assets. It requires Inttegro Python SDK 6.3.0 or newer because the Worker
must await outbound HTTP. Use `uv run pywrangler dev` to exercise the Worker
runtime locally. See
[`DEPLOYING.md`](https://github.com/zebodotdev/inttegro-demos/blob/v1.8.3/DEPLOYING.md) for provider details. The package `predeploy`
hook also builds Angular before Wrangler uploads Cloudflare Static Assets.

## Understand the integration

Start with [`src/app/checkout.py`](./src/app/checkout.py) for the typed Order
request and safe error mapping, then read [`src/app/main.py`](./src/app/main.py)
for the FastAPI JSON/303 handoff and verification boundary. Continue with
[`client/checkout-flow.component.ts`](./client/checkout-flow.component.ts) for
the standalone Angular component and
[`client/main.ts`](./client/main.ts) for its narrow mounting point. The
`INTTEGRO:*` comments map choices and alternatives to the shared
[integration guide](https://github.com/zebodotdev/inttegro-demos/blob/v1.8.3/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) and
[machine-readable decision registry](https://github.com/zebodotdev/inttegro-demos/blob/v1.8.3/integration-decisions.json).
