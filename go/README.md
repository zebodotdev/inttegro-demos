# Inttegro + Go demo

**Ledgerline** is a polished client invoice portal built on idiomatic
`net/http`. Customers review service lines and settle INV-2048 through an
Inttegro-hosted checkout created entirely on the server.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
set -a && source .env && set +a
go mod download
go run .
```

Open <http://localhost:3003>. Configure `INTTEGRO_DEMO_PRODUCT_ID` and
`INTTEGRO_DEMO_PRICE_ID` with the active Ledgerline retainer Product and Price.
The service resolves and validates both before constructing the Order; the
invoice form cannot choose its own service or amount. Run `go test ./...` for
the focused checks.

## Run with Docker

After configuring `.env`, run `docker compose up --build --wait`. Compose
starts the distroless production image at <http://localhost:3003>. Use
`docker compose down` to stop it. Set `INTTEGRO_DEMO_PUBLIC_URL` to the exact
HTTPS origin before exposing the container publicly.

Cloud Run, Railway, and Render build a small distroless image from the released
multi-stage Dockerfile. The deployment links target immutable release refs. See
[`DEPLOYING.md`](../DEPLOYING.md).

## Understand the integration

[`main.go`](./main.go) keeps the complete integration deliberately visible:
input validation, Order construction, hosted URL selection, safe errors,
correlation, and the 303 handoff. Its `INTTEGRO:*` comments map choices and
alternatives to the shared [integration guide](../INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) and
[machine-readable decision registry](../integration-decisions.json).
