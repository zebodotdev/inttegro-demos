# Inttegro SwiftUI demo

**Kora Market** is an iPhone-first product experience with category browsing,
product imagery, finish selection, fulfillment context, and a persistent native
checkout bar. It imports **Inttegro SDK** through Swift Package Manager and
presents the SDK's SwiftUI payment sheet without embedding a merchant API key.

The app asks the Kora Market backend for a finalized mobile-money-only order,
then uses the SDK's native Checkout transport. Payment-sheet telemetry is sent
to the host app's unified logging category without installing an exporter.

## Run

Requirements: Xcode 16 or newer and XcodeGen 2.44 or newer.

```sh
xcodegen generate
open InttegroSwiftUIDemo.xcodeproj
```

Set `INTTEGRO_DEMO_BACKEND_URL` in the scheme environment to the reachable
Next.js demo origin, then choose an iPhone simulator and run the
`InttegroSwiftUIDemo` scheme. For the simulator, `http://127.0.0.1:3000` is a
typical local value.

## Check

```sh
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild build \
  -project InttegroSwiftUIDemo.xcodeproj \
  -scheme InttegroSwiftUIDemo \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

A production app receives only a finalized `orderID` from its merchant backend.
Payment completion must still be verified on the server.

## Capture the native payment sheet

For documentation screenshots, launch a Debug build with
`INTTEGRO_STUDIO_SCREENSHOTS=1`. This opens the real SDK payment sheet with a
deterministic, local checkout fixture; it does not call the Inttegro API or
create a payment.

```sh
SIMCTL_CHILD_INTTEGRO_STUDIO_SCREENSHOTS=1 \
  xcrun simctl launch --terminate-running-process booted \
  com.inttegro.demo.swiftui

xcrun simctl io booted screenshot --mask alpha payment-sheet.png
```

The switch is compiled only in Debug builds. Release builds always use the
SDK's live Checkout adapter.

The fixture opens on the attached payment method. Choose **Change payment
method** to capture active number entry; the SDK expands to the large detent.
Enable **Save for next time** to capture the full personal/contact form. The
fields are native controls and the values entered for a screenshot remain
local to that simulator run.

The screenshot fixture follows the complete native flow. Choose **Pay** to
capture the one-time-code screen, enter any six digits and choose **Continue**
to capture the approval screen, then choose **Check again** to capture
`Payment complete`. No payment is created.

Use `INTTEGRO_STUDIO_SCREENSHOTS=features` to capture the optional-feature
story. The opening sheet offers a collapsed Order summary and keeps the attached
payment method fixed. Opening the summary expands the sheet to the large detent
as the Checkout-provided line items are revealed. Its completed state offers
both invoice and receipt downloads. These links use inert documentation URLs
and should not be opened during capture.

## Deploy the companion backend

These buttons create the Next.js companion service in your own account. Put its
public origin in `INTTEGRO_DEMO_BACKEND_URL`; the native app never receives the
server-held Inttegro API key. The buttons use release `v1.7.0`.

## Understand the integration

Start with [`DemoBackend.swift`](./InttegroSwiftUIDemo/DemoBackend.swift) for the
merchant-backend trust boundary, then read
[`CheckoutView.swift`](./InttegroSwiftUIDemo/CheckoutView.swift) for payment
sheet configuration, presentation, telemetry, and result semantics. The
`INTTEGRO:*` comments map choices and alternatives to the shared
[integration guide](../INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) and
[machine-readable decision registry](../integration-decisions.json).
