# Deploying Inttegro demos

Every deploy button is part of the demo's public contract. A button must point
to immutable released source, request only the environment values the app
actually consumes, and be exercised through a provider-owned preview before it
is marked verified.

[`deployments.json`](./deployments.json) is the machine-readable source of truth
for supported providers, intended `inttegro.dev` hosts, environment aliases,
configuration files, readiness, and known blockers. Documentation and the demo
catalogue derive their labels from it rather than guessing from the presence of
a provider logo.

## Reader experience

Every server demo offers four adjacent actions:

1. **Deploy this demo** opens a provider chooser and identifies the idiomatic
   target as Recommended.
2. **Run locally** opens that demo's setup instructions.
3. **View tagged source** opens the immutable per-demo release tag.
4. **Understand the integration** opens the commented SDK boundary and shared
   decision guide.

The provider flow must tell the reader which services will be created, which
values may cost money, and which variables they need before leaving Inttegro
documentation. A missing key is a setup state, not an application failure.

## Environment contract

All server demos require a dedicated `INTTEGRO_API_KEY`. Nuxt exposes the same
server-only value under `NUXT_INTTEGRO_API_KEY` because Nuxt runtime config uses
that prefix. Never add a browser-visible prefix such as `NEXT_PUBLIC_`,
`NUXT_PUBLIC_`, or `VITE_` to the API key. Prefer the narrowest key type your
account offers, dedicate it to the demo deployment, and rotate or revoke it
without affecting another workload.

`INTTEGRO_DEMO_PRODUCT_ID` and `INTTEGRO_DEMO_PRICE_ID` identify an active
Product and one active Price belonging to it. Nuxt uses
`NUXT_DEMO_PRODUCT_ID` and `NUXT_DEMO_PRICE_ID`. The server looks up the Product
at checkout, validates the configured pair, and supplies authoritative catalog
data to order creation. These IDs are configuration, not secrets, but they must
not be accepted from the public request because the customer cannot choose the
merchant's product or amount.

`INTTEGRO_DEMO_PUBLIC_URL` (or `NUXT_DEMO_PUBLIC_URL`) is the exact deployed
origin without a trailing slash. Requiring an explicit value avoids trusting an
attacker-controlled `Host` or forwarded-host header when the application builds
completion and cancellation URLs. Provider templates may ask for this value
after the provider assigns its initial hostname.

The Next.js companion backend also requires `INTTEGRO_DEMO_CUSTOMER_ID`, a
dedicated customer used to create the four native demos' finalized orders. It remains on
the server alongside the API key and is not required by the other web demos.

Framework-generated signing secrets such as `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`,
`SECRET_KEY_BASE`, and `APP_KEY` belong to the reader's deployment and must be
generated there. They are never shared Inttegro credentials.

## Docker and Compose

Every container-capable server demo includes a production Dockerfile. Next.js
uses its standalone Node output, Nuxt ships only Nitro's production output,
and the other container targets retain their idiomatic minimal runtimes.
RedwoodSDK is intentionally excluded: its server-first application targets the
Cloudflare Workers runtime directly, so presenting a generic Node container as
equivalent would misrepresent the framework. Native demos are device
applications rather than servers; deploy their shared Next.js companion
backend when a reachable container endpoint is needed.

Every currently runnable server demo also includes a Compose contract for the
common local self-hosting path. After copying and configuring the environment
example, `docker compose up --build --wait` builds the image, starts it in the
background, and returns when it is running or healthy. Runtime-capable images
monitor `GET /health`; Go retains its intentionally minimal distroless runtime
and relies on an external probe.
Spring Boot joins this path when the Java SDK release gate described below is
cleared.

This is a one-command container run, not a universal cloud deployment button:
Docker cannot choose an infrastructure account, provision DNS or TLS, or create
production secrets. Provider buttons wrap the same released Dockerfiles with
those platform-specific steps.

## Provider choices

- **Cloudflare Workers** is prepared for Next.js through OpenNext, for Nuxt
  through Nitro's Cloudflare preset, for Express through Cloudflare's Node
  HTTP adapter, and natively for RedwoodSDK, FastAPI, and Django. FastAPI and
  Django use the async-first Python SDK; Django's ASGI
  adapter keeps framework hooks that are known to be non-blocking inside the
  single-threaded Worker runtime. These variants preserve the framework's
  application and SDK boundary; adapters exist only at deployment boundaries.
- **Vercel** is prepared for Next.js and Nuxt, where the platform can retain the
  framework-native build and routing model.
- **Render** uses a Dockerfile and per-demo Blueprint, including NestJS. The
  Blueprint disables
  automatic deploys so a reader's released example does not silently begin
  following upstream changes.
- **Railway** uses the same Dockerfile plus restart policy and, except for
  Rails, an HTTP health probe. Rails redirects Railway's internal HTTP probe to
  HTTPS, so its template uses process readiness while retaining the public
  HTTPS `GET /health` endpoint. Each one-click template is pinned to both the
  immutable per-demo deployment branch and its exact release commit. The direct
  template URLs are shareable without a marketplace listing; marketplace
  publication remains a separate branding and discovery decision.
- **Google Cloud Run** uses the release Dockerfile and a checked-in `app.json`
  contract. The button prompts for the Inttegro key and catalog IDs, caps the
  service at three instances, and writes the provider-assigned HTTPS origin
  back to `INTTEGRO_DEMO_PUBLIC_URL` after creation. Release 1.5.0 makes the
  contracts launchable for Express, Django, FastAPI, Go, Rails, Laravel, and NestJS
  from immutable deployment branches. They remain `prepared` until each button
  passes the fresh-account verification gates below. NestJS has the same
  same cost-capped contract.
- **AWS App Runner** is displayed as unavailable rather than linked to a
  misleading generic console page. AWS stopped accepting new App Runner
  customers on March 31, 2026, source deployment requires an account-specific
  GitHub or Bitbucket connection, and the current release does not publish
  portable images to ECR Public. Existing AWS customers can still adapt the
  Dockerfiles, but there is no honest public one-click path for every reader.

First-party hosting is recorded separately under each demo's `live` object in
`deployments.json`. The `provider` there identifies where Inttegro runs the
public example; it does not make that provider reader-launchable. Provider
buttons continue to follow the `providers` list and require a prepared manifest
or a verified public template.

Release 1.5.0 replaces Django and FastAPI's synchronous network boundary with
`AsyncInttegroClient`, moves both applications to ASGI-native handlers, and
includes host-neutral Worker and static-asset configuration. Both Worker builds
and their health, page, static asset, validation, and safe configuration-error
paths have passed local workerd runtime checks.

Spring Boot remains remote-deployment gated until Java SDK 5.0.0 is public. The
Dockerfile and provider manifests are checked in so the gate can be removed and
verified without changing the integration example.

## Immutable deployment refs

Canonical source tags continue to point to one suite commit. Some providers
expect their configuration at repository root, so releases also publish one
generated subtree branch per deployable demo:

```text
deploy-nextjs-v1.8.2
deploy-express-v1.8.2
deploy-nuxt-v1.8.2
...
```

These branches are deployment artifacts, not canonical source references. Each
is created from the matching directory at the suite tag, records that source tag
in `INTTEGRO_DEMO_RELEASE.json`, includes the tagged repository license, rewrites
shared README links to their immutable suite-tag URLs, and is never force-updated
or reused. Studio permalinks continue to use the signed per-demo tag.

Run the branch preparation script only after the suite tag exists:

```sh
node scripts/prepare-deploy-refs.mjs v1.8.2
```

The script creates local branches but never pushes them. Inspect each branch,
push its exact name explicitly, protect it from force-pushes, and then register
the Railway templates.

## Verification gates

A provider changes from `prepared` to `verified` only after all of these pass:

1. Fresh deploy through the public button or template—not an existing internal
   project.
2. `GET /health` returns 200 and identifies the expected demo.
3. The home page, static assets, form validation, cancellation return, and
   missing-configuration state render correctly over HTTPS.
4. With a dedicated key and configured Product/Price pair, one checkout reaches the Inttegro-hosted URL and
   no key appears in HTML, JavaScript, redirect query strings, or provider logs.
5. The deployed release metadata matches the tag advertised by the catalogue.
6. The user can clone or eject the deployed source and modify it independently.

The public catalogue is `demos.inttegro.dev`; demo hosts use
`{demo-id}-demo.inttegro.dev`. The `inttegro.dev` zone is active on Cloudflare.
Custom-domain bindings are intentionally absent from the reader-facing Wrangler
files: Inttegro attaches them during release deployment, while every cloned demo
starts host-neutral in the reader's account.
